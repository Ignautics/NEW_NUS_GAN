# vector-to-image using condition-gan【NUS_GAN】
## Overview
This is a tensorflow implementation of generating face images using condition-GAN named NUS_GAN. We've gotten great progress on the basis of [DCGAN](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) after using our algorithm. At present, this is just a preliminary version and coupled with our lack of ability, maybe there are still some problems in the codes. Please fell free to correct us.

The following is the model architecture.
